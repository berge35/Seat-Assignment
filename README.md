# Seat-Assignment
This project is designed to assign airplane seating based on passenger criteria. Seats are assigned to space passengers apart as well as honor passenger seating preferences.
This implementation focuses on a Boeing 737-800 aircraft with seat capacity of 159, 12 of those being first class seats.
